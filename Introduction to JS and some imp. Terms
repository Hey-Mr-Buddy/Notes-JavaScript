--> JavaScript! What is it ?
          JavaScript also reffered as JS is one of the 3 fundamental languages essential for web developers. 
          In a web page, HTML defines the structure, CSS makes it beautiful but JS is the one which makes it interactive.
              note that java and javascript are two different programming languages both in concept and design.

          JavaScript became an ECMA standard in 1997 and is also reffered as ECMAScript.
              ECMA is european computer manufacturers association. It develops and publishes international standard for information and communication industry.

--> javascript doesn't needs to be installed, it is already present in your machine.
          Open any browser; right click on any element; click inspect and go to console, console - it is where you can write and run your JavaScript program.

--> How to print my JS program?

              1) writing into an HTML Element,using - innerHTML
              2) writing into your HTML Output, using - document.write()

one of the best ide to practice JS is Replit


Let's get started!


--> what are literals and identifiers ???

          literals are basiclly those which don't change while identifiers are the names of variables, methods,classes, packages, and interfaces. Identifiers are those which can change their values.
          
              variables are the names of location where a data is stored, and the type of data stored is called data type.
              note that the names of variables are case sensitive and can contain letters, numbers, underscore and $ symbol.
              also name of a reserved words in JS can not be used as names of variables.
          
              some of the reserved words i.e. keywords are- 
                    var          -   declares a variable
                    let          -   declares a block variable
                    if           -   marks a block of statement to be executed on condition
                    switch       -   to mark a block of statement to be executed on different case
                    for          -   marks a block of statement to be executed in a loop
                    function     -   declares a function
                    return       -   exits a function
              

--> differentiation between var, let and const

      var is globally scoped while let and const are block scoped
      
      var can be updated and redeclared within the scope
      let can be updated but cannot be redeclared
      const can neither be updated nor be redeclared
