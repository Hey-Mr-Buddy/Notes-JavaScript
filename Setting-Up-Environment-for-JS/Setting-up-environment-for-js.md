As JS is a scripting language it needs a runtime environment and an IDE to run outside of the browser.  
IDE: VS Code  
https://code.visualstudio.com/download  

Runtime Environment: Node.js  
https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer   

now we will create environment for this javascript repo on github:
open the repository
click on "Code"
click on "Codespaces"
click on "Create codespace on main", this open up VS Code
go to "View" and click on "Command Palette..." or press "ctrl + shift + P".  
search ">container"
