### Origins (1995)  
JavaScript was created by **Brendan Eich** as a lightweight scripting language for web pages.  
It helped in boosting interactivity with the webpages.  
  
### Standardisation - ECMAScript (1997)  
after launch of JS several other version like Microsoft's JScript led to compatibility issues in the browsers.  
Therefore, ECMA International standardised it as ECMAScript, allowing cross-browser consistency.  
  
### Server-Side JavaScript - Node.js (2009)  
Node.js (a run-time environment), created by **Ryan Dahl**, allowed JS to run outside the browser on the server for the first time in 2009.  
This leveraged **V8** (Chrome's JavaScript engine launched in 2008) for high-performance backend operations by using it to outside of the browser (in Node.js), making JavaScipt viable for full-stack (client-side and server-side) development.  
  
Overtime, several frameworks of JavaScipt were launched like **Angular JS**, **React** and **Vue**, transforming JavaScipt into a powerful tool for building **Single-Page Applications (SPAs)** withg dynamic user interfaces.
